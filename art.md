1. Children of Paradise part 1, 2: This movie was the first pop movie I had seen in a while. I really enjoyed the character introductions- the people you'd least expect to drive the plot are later revealed to be protagonists.  
2. (Original Cast Album) Company: What got me into musicals
3. Hoop Dreams: I watched this movie over two days. So revelatory. Following the cast today, makes me realize how poignant this story is.
4. Old Joy: A really calm movie- not one I expected to really like. 
5. Ata me: A really interesting ending- I did not expect such a powerful movie to end in a way that I thought catered to a populist audience
6. Clemency: Not into really high budget films, but one I really liked. I enjoyed the acting of all the cast, and wished a few were given more screen time (specifically the prisoner)
7. M: Not my favorite villain till the very end, and a very interesting climax. However, the plot as a whole was a blend of amusement and serious, which I found to be lost to time.
8. La Cienaga: A slow movie, but one with great promise
9. Metropolitan: One of my favorites. This genre really appeals to my character- quick witted, great dialogue, characters used well.
10. Roshomon: Classic- I dont think I get the appeal entirely. 
11. Seven Samurai: Classic
12. Ikiru: Classic
13. Andrei Rublev: Solid movie. Took me 3 days to watch it. 
14. Battleship Potemkin: Tough movie to watch. The ending was really captivating
15. Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles: Really poignant
16. La Grande Bellezza: One of my faves
17. Vivek (Reason): Woke me to the Indian left
18. Paris, Texas: Slow, but interesting character development
19. 8 1/2: Really good. Slow, deep, thoughtful, meta.
20. The Piano Teacher: Critics noted it as dark. I agree, but praise the acting and story.
21. Oldboy- the korean version. Easily one of my favorite movies.
22. Tokyo Story- havent watched the last 20 mins, but till then, again a favorite
23. Tampopo- Also one of my favorite movies
24. The work- I cried non stop during the movie- easily one of my favorites
25. Pablo Neruda- Great film 
26. Dr. Strangelove- watched it on a plane, dunno if it was edited from its original. Thought it ran a bit short.
27. Anthropocene
28. Washington (2006 I think)- Not one I enjoyed very much
29. The handmaiden (Korean): Nice film, nice plot twist. Nice cinematography, memorable acting. Thought some of the supporting cast could have been worked in.
30. Anthropocene: Legit one of the best. The carrara scene is my spirit animal
31. Tiny: The story of Erin Blackwell: Made me realize (like Washington) that the American poor are really in a terrible place. Income inequality really makes me feel worse about my capitalist leanings
32. Portrait of a Lady on Fire: Didn't like it too too much, thought the set direction and camera work were amazing. The story seemed to be well paced in the first hour and a bit, and the relationship rushed. 
33. Darjeeling limited: Thought there were some moments of stillness that were unintentionally uncomfortable. The prequel had its moments of subtle tension, but a dragged ending if I remember correctly. The choice of music was highly regarded.
34. La Strada: The movie is not about the protagonist's perspective, but the world around her. I found the role of the protagonist to be a fly on the wall. 
35. Mouchette: Very similar to La Strada, but a bit more involved. 
36. The red shoes: Another one similar in presentation to children of paradise. I really liked the performances, not a dull moment in the film. No villain, which I found nice. I thought the ending was weak but I personally dont like tragedies. Again, if there's no rabbit in the hat, you can't pull a rabbit out of the hat. 
37. Makala
38. The Love Godesses 
39. Becoming a spy
40. Tenet: What a confusing movie. Really didn't understand wtf was going on.
41. Bullet Train: More than the movie, the experienceo fo watching it at the Alamo drafthouse really made the experience worthwhile for me. 
42. The headless woman: Another art house movie I failed to understand. My stupidity amazes me, even when it shouldn't. Slow, complex and subtle, it forces me to ask questions at the speed of F1 that my Indycar 500 brain can't drive at.
