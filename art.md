I like movies. Who doesn't..

I will write movies here. If you watch them, message me.

1. Children of Paradise part 1, 2: This movie was the first pop movie I had seen in a while. I really enjoyed the character introductions- the people you'd least expect to drive the plot are later revealed to be protagonists. 
2. (Original Cast Album) Company: What got me into musicals
3. Hoop Dreams: I watched this movie over two days. So revelatory. Following the cast today, makes me realize how poignant this story is.
4. Old Joy: A really calm movie- not one I expected to really like. 
5. Ata me: A really interesting ending- I did not expect such a powerful movie to end in a way that I thought catered to a populist audience
6. Clemency: Not into really high budget films, but one I really liked. I enjoyed the acting of all the cast, and wished a few were given more screen time (specifically the prisoner)
7. M: Not my favorite villain till the very end, and a very interesting climax. However, the plot as a whole was a blend of amusement and serious, which I found to be lost to time.
8. La Cienaga: A slow movie, but one with great promise
9. Metropolitan: One of my favorites. This genre really appeals to my character- quick witted, great dialogue, characters used well.
10. Roshomon: Classic
11. Seven Samurai: Classic
12. Ikiru: Classic
13. Andrei Rublev: Solid movie. Took me 3 days to watch it. 
14. Battleship Potemkin: Tough movie to watch. The ending was really captivating
15. Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles: Really poignant
16. La Grande Bellezza: One of my fave
17. Vivek (Reason): Woke me to the Indian left
18. Paris, Texas: Slow, but interesting character development

I enjoy art. If you enjoy any of these pieces, let me know. I want to know that I am in good company.

Music
1. Jon Higgins' Endharo Mahanubavulu 
> Higgins was so proficient in Carnatic music that he was called Higgins Bhagvathar. When he visited the Udupi Shri Krishna temple, he was denied entry because of his white skin by those who managed the temple. He stood at the gate and sang in chaste Kannada the Vyasatirtha composition, ‘Krishna nee begane baro’ , an action that was similar to Kanaka Dasa's protest in 16th century. He was permitted entry immediately, possibly to avert an 'intervention from the deity', that Kanaka Dasa's legend spoke of.
