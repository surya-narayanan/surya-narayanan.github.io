1. Children of Paradise part 1, 2: This movie was the first pop movie I had seen in a while. I really enjoyed the character introductions- the people you'd least expect to drive the plot are later revealed to be protagonists.  
2. (Original Cast Album) Company: What got me into musicals
3. Hoop Dreams: I watched this movie over two days. So revelatory. Following the cast today, makes me realize how poignant this story is.
4. Old Joy: A really calm movie- not one I expected to really like. 
5. Ata me: A really interesting ending- I did not expect such a powerful movie to end in a way that I thought catered to a populist audience
6. Clemency: Not into really high budget films, but one I really liked. I enjoyed the acting of all the cast, and wished a few were given more screen time (specifically the prisoner)
7. M: Not my favorite villain till the very end, and a very interesting climax. However, the plot as a whole was a blend of amusement and serious, which I found to be lost to time.
8. La Cienaga: A slow movie, but one with great promise
9. Metropolitan: One of my favorites. This genre really appeals to my character- quick witted, great dialogue, characters used well.
<!-- 10. Roshomon: Classic- I dont think I get the appeal entirely.  -->
<!-- 11. Seven Samurai: Classic -->
<!-- 12. Ikiru: Classic -->
13. Andrei Rublev: Solid movie. Took me 3 days to watch it. 
14. Battleship Potemkin: Tough movie to watch. The ending was really captivating
<!-- 15. Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles: Really poignant -->
16. La Grande Bellezza: One of my faves
17. Vivek (Reason): Woke me to the Indian left
18. Paris, Texas: Slow, but interesting character development
19. 8 1/2: Really good. Slow, deep, thoughtful, meta.
20. The Piano Teacher: Critics noted it as dark. I agree, but praise the acting and story.
21. Oldboy- the korean version. Easily one of my favorite movies.
<!-- 22. Tokyo Story- havent watched the last 20 mins, but till then, again a favorite -->
23. Tampopo- Also one of my favorite movies
24. The work- I cried non stop during the movie- easily one of my favorites
25. Pablo Neruda- Great film 
26. Dr. Strangelove- watched it on a plane, dunno if it was edited from its original. Thought it ran a bit short.
27. Anthropocene
28. Washington (2006 I think)- Not one I enjoyed very much
29. The handmaiden (Korean): Nice film, nice plot twist. Nice cinematography, memorable acting. Thought some of the supporting cast could have been worked in.
