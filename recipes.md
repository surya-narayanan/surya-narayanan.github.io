I will write recipes here. If you make them, venmo me $10. Support small businesses. 

1. Cauliflower tomato soup- Massage olive oil into a cauliflower. Throw it into the oven at 400 with some onions, garlic and tomatoes. Blend the lot after an hour, add water, salt, oregano or any italian spice mix

2. Grilled cheese- I have found that Cheddar and Romano with cut hot peppers make a great grilled cheese. 

3. A fig sandwich. Cut fresh figs, tomatoes and cucumbers. Place between slices of rye / white with mustard, cheese, butter, hot sauce and hummus. I used a peachy hot sauce. The key is to attack the sweet, spicy and umami taste receptors. 

4. I've been experimenting with random things to throw into whole wheat flour while making dough for roti. I've found raddish is a great binder, and imparts a subtle salty acidic flavor, with nitrogenous notes. A hint of turmeric, salt and paprika, go well (could also add cumin to the dough). Interestingly, I found that using coconut milk instead of water did not affect the taste of the roti much, and grating ginger instead of raddish made it very hard to roll but was somewhat tasty. I found that using a thin pan instead of a cast iron pan, made the roti easier to work with, since the cast iron pan would cook the dough all the way through and make it more biscuity.
