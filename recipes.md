I will write recipes here. If you make them, venmo me $10. Support small businesses. 

1. Potato leek soup- classic french staple. Bake potatoes, saut√© leeks, add spices (Thyme? Lemongrass? Mint?). Puree, add water, salt.
2. Spinach soup- sautee spinach, fry onions garlic and walnuts in butter. Blend the lot, then bring milk in a pan to warm and add a bit of flour, stir and mix in the blend. Salt.
3. Cauliflower tomato soup- Massage olive oil into a cauliflower. Throw it into the oven at 400 with some onions, garlic and tomatoes. Blend the lot after an hour, add water, salt, oregano?
4. Curry Ramen- borrowed recipe from guy on internet. Use yakisoba noodles to make easier. Boil carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, babycorn, peas in salt, turmeric, red chili powder. Saute onions, peppers and keep aside. Add cumin, coriander (cilantro) seed powder, coconut milk, jamaican allspice? (or any savory sweet spice to take the edge off), ginger garlic paste, and mix in peppers and onions. Garnish with spring onions, habanero, cilantro and charge eater $25.
5. Cheeses
5.1 I have learned to enjoy a good cheddar. Wisconsin, New York, Vermont, India- all have good cheddars. Really good in a grilled cheese
5.2 I am eager to try an emmenthaler. 
5.3 Tried a Romano, not too bad- especially with a cheddar in a grilled cheese with the cauliflower soup
