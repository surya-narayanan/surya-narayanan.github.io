1. Short story: There was once a doctor who lived in a city. He was fairly well off, lived in a duplex with his wife and sixteen year old boy. The boy loved video games, his wife loved to host. His patients were often people without life threatening illnesses, often came to have something checked, fixed or cleaned. He was feeling a loss of meaning in his work. He realized it when his dog jumped out of his wifes purse when she was standing on the handrail of their staircase, and she grabbed the leash instead of letting the dog fall down. Watching the dog hang by the leash, sent a shiver in him that woke him out of his stupor. He decided he needed a break, and went to a deserted building to get a hold of himself. He saw a girl in pink playing in the park, skipping through a hopscotch. He found some respite in her joy, and left the building, vowing never to be that dramatic again. He went to his boss and told him how he felt. His boss forced him on paid leave. He didn't want to tell his wife he'd been put on leave, lest she worry. He went on a long drive, but couldn't find his old self. He told his wife that night, and they planned a vacation. The trip came and went, but he was still on edge, unable to come out of his panic. He later met his friends, a chef, a tennis player and an actor- all moderately successful people with a common interest in being affectionate. He enjoyed listening to the talkative chef, and the reticence of the tennis player. He told them of his worry, and they looked at one another for the right words. Last, the tennis player, broke the silence with how he has accomplished everything in his life and needs to find something to work towards. He realized that was his hurdle, that he had nothing to work towards. The next day, the protagonist walks into his workplace, with a new face.
